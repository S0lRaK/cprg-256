    <p>Here is a report from Bloomberg</p>
    <p>Dynamic scoring, as adopted on Jan. 6 by the House of Representatives, seems like the ultimate no-brainer.
      Reasonably enough, it requires the House to take long-run macroeconomic effects into consideration when deciding
      how to vote on tax and spending bills. Dynamic scoring makes tax cuts look better from a budgetary standpoint
      because it assumes they will stimulate economic activity. You don’t have to be an acolyte of Arthur Laffer to
      believe that lower income tax rates will cause people to work at least a little harder and pay a little more to
      the Internal Revenue Service, helping to offset the revenue lost from the tax cut.

      The problem with dynamic scoring isn’t political. It’s actually a problem of computer programming that’s well
      known to experts in the field, Republicans and Democrats alike, but hard to convey to the general public. It has
      to do with something that economists call the “transversality condition”—easier to remember if you think of it as
      the kerflooey problem.

    <p>This was a recent story reported on CBC:
      An asteroid bigger than the world's most massive cruise ships will fly past the Earth today, and will be visible
      from Canada with strong binoculars or a small telescope – or you can watch it streamed online starting at 11 a.m.

      Watch live starting 11 a.m.

      Based on its brightness, asteroid 2004 BL86 is estimated to be about 500 metres across. If it were sitting on the
      Earth, it would be as tall as Toronto's CN Tower.

    <p>New about upcoming Windows 10</p>
    <p>
      Microsoft showed us the final version of Windows 10 in an event yesterday, and the roll-out will begin later this
      year. But what’s new in Microsoft’s latest OS? We take a quick look at the biggest and most important features of
      Windows 10.

      Free, free, free: For the first time ever, Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and
      Windows Phone 8.1 users.

      As we noted here, Microsoft has taken a cue out of Apple’s book which has been given OS X and iOS upgrades away
      for free, to ensure that users don’t have to shell out money for an OS.

      If your PC or laptop is running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 and your Windows phone has the Windows Phone 8.1 OS,
      you will get a free upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10 – in the first year.

      What is not clear is if users on laptop and desktops will have to pay after the first year. In an age, where free
      OS and software is the new mantra, Microsoft has taken the right step by making Windows 10 free of cost.
      Hopefully the free upgrade will continue after year one as well.
