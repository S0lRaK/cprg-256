        <p><span class="first-letter">S</span>ir William Edmond Logan, geologist, first director of the GEOLOGICAL
            SURVEY OF CANADA (b at Montréal 20 Apr 1798; d at Castle Malgwyn, Cilgerran, S Wales 22 June 1875). Logan
            identified and mapped the major geological structures of the Province of Canada, in particular the
            Laurentian and Huronian series of the Precambrian SHIELD. He attended Alexander Skakel's school in Montréal
            and the Edinburgh High School, Scotland. In 1816 he took a year of medical studies at the U of Edinburgh
            before entering an uncle's business.</p>

    <p><span class="first-letter">F</span>rom 1831 Logan managed the Forest Copper Works near Swansea, in South
        Wales. A systematic thinker by nature, and anxious to find a reliable source of coal, he mapped the nearby
        coal seams topographically and cross-sectionally. These highly accurate maps were adopted by the Geological
        Survey of Great Britain. In 1840 Logan read to the Geological Society of London his theory of the in situ
        formation of coal, which enabled geologists to determine the location of workable deposits of carboniferous
        strata. Logan's reputation as a geologist, his Canadian birth, and his social and family connections in
        Montréal secured him the position of geologist of the Province of Canada in April 1842.</p>

        <p><span class="first-letter">B</span>y 1844 Logan and one assistant, Alexander MURRAY, had divided the
            geological formations of the province into 3 main divisions; he concluded reluctantly that none could be
            expected to yield coal. But Logan justified continued public funding of the Survey in other ways. He
            founded a geological museum; mapped the often uncharted lands he surveyed; analysed the copper-bearing
            north shore of Lake Superior. As a result of his outstanding collection of Canadian minerals and his
            geological map of Canada, exhibited at London's Crystal Palace in 1851, Logan became the first native
            Canadian inducted into the Royal Society of London for achievements in Canada.</p>

            the Legion of Honour. A knighthood followed in 1856. While the Survey continued investigations in both
            laboratory and field, Logan in 1863 published Geology of Canada, followed in 1865 by an atlas and in 1869
            by a larger geological map. This masterly analysis of Canada's geological structures and economic minerals
            earned Logan the Royal Society's Gold Medal in 1867.</p>

    <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he enormous expansion of the Geological Survey after Confederation had
        been anticipated by Logan as a natural development. He retired to South Wales in 1869 and was succeeded by
        A.R.C. SELWYN. Undaunted by the "Herculean task," Logan had forged Canada's first public scientific
        endeavour from its initial precarious decades into a permanent institution. </p>
