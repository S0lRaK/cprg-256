        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>3D printing is a new technology that has a direct impact on medical industry. There are two main things that
            help in advancement in hospitals.

        </p>
        <h3>Faster Productions</h3>
        <p>Products can quickly move forward from design to prototype which means that can shorten a lot of time to make
            what the patients need such as personalized prosthesis, organs, blood vessels, etc. 
            <a href="references.html#ref4">[4]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref5">[5]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref6">[6]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref7">[7]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref8">[8]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>
        </p>
        <p>Making these products, the first thing is the medical data collected. This is generated from patients, which is
            unique to the individual. The medical data must be segmented and processed according to anatomical features.
            Data preparation can take longer and it limits medical or surgical procedures which involve long-time planning
            rather than emergency operation.

        </p>
        <h3>Cost Down</h3>
        <p>Most medication treatments are expensive, especially for organ transplants but 3D printing can lower down the
            cost for the issue. For example, when patients need to exchange organs and extend their life, but it always
            costs a lot of money and time for surgical processes as well. However, this technology can resolve this issue
            between doctors and patients, as scientists have succeeded in printing 3D structures with living cells by using
            a new technique called ‘in-air microfluidics’. Printing important organs is one of the biggest advantages of 3D
            printing due to its cost-effectiveness in the medical sector. 
            <a href="references.html#ref4">[4]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref5">[5]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref6">[6]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref7">[7]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref8">[8]</a> 
            <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>
        </p>
        <p>As a result, 3D printing enables doctors to work faster, shorten patient recovery time and improve operation
            results.
