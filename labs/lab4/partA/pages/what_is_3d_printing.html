        <h2>What is 3D Printing?</h2>
        <p>According to Oxford dictionaries, “3D printing is the action or process of making a physical 
            object from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of 
            a material in succession” <a href="references.html#ref1">[1]</a></p>    
        <p>The first step in the 3D printing process is the creation of the blueprint of a given object 
            made by a software. Then the printer interprets this blueprint and throws the melt material 
            through a tube depositing into a plate where gets cooled immediately, starting from the base 
            then building up until the whole object is finished.</p>
