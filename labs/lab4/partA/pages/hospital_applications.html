        <h2>Hospital Applications</h2>
        <p>In some hospitals, 3D printing technology is being used to make toys for children. Those toys are made upon
            patientâ€™s requests. According to Global News <a href="references.html#ref14">[14]</a>, doctors use those toys for therapeutic purposes. It helps
            children cope with pain and anxiety during treatments. With 3D printing technology, toys can be made very fast
            and in large quantities. Moreover, money that hospitals have to spend for toys can be much lower since 3D
            printer materials price are continually dropping.</p>

        <p>Besides, applying 3D printing in re-creating body part is trending nowadays. Not only because it is much more
            affordable than traditional ways, but also it is easier to design and faster to print out. Many hospitals
            around the world try to apply this technology into their treatment. For example, a dad in UK designed and 3D
            printed a prosthetic arm for his son <a href="references.html#ref15">[15]</a>. This technology is so easy that even a normal family can access it
            and make prosthetic body parts for those who need them.</p>

        <p>Since 3D printers can be used to replicate body parts, surgeons came up with new applications. For example, 3D
            printing has helped surgeons treat pediatric heart disease <a href="references.html#ref16">[16]</a> or to remove 50 tumors <a href="references.html#ref17">[17]</a>. Surgeons can use
            replica models to practice before the real surgery and understand more about the case. This will help the
            surgery run much smoother, since the surgeons already have based understanding about the case.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, some universities and hospitals around the world are trying to apply 3D printing into making tools
            for surgery. So far, the results from those researches are positive. According to Journal of Surgical Research
            website, the cost of 3D printing instruments are only 1/10th the cost of stainless-steel instruments <a href="references.html#ref18">[18]</a>. This
            could be a trend in the future. Since it is not only cheaper but also customizable, it is suitable with the
            cases that they are working on.</p>
