        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>3D printing is a technology that creates objects from blueprints, mostly used for prototyping which cost have
            decreased throughout the years. The main advantages of this technology are the reduced costs and time-saving in
            production. Even though this technology has some disadvantages such as the limited use of materials,
            questionable accuracy and copyrights violation, the big amount of applications and benefits that 3D printing
            offers in hospitals are much higher. On top of that, the revenue expectations are to double from 2015 in only
            three years.</p>
