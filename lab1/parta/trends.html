        <h2>Trends</h2>
        <p>People have been using 3D printer for more than 30 years already, but the costs of them where only
            achievable by a few. It is only in the last decade that the technology has reached the masses and its usage
            has exploded into multiple applications.</p>
        <h3>Worldwide Uses</h3>
        <p>According to an online worldwide survey made to a thousand participants by Sculpteo in May 2018, the top uses
            for 3D printing in the last three years have been prototyping, production and proof of concept (Figure 1) [2].</p>
        <p>Prototyping has always been the top use during this timing with more than 50% except in 2017, and as can be
            seen above (Figure 1), 3D printing as a hobby has switched into professional areas from 2015 onwards.</p>
        <h3>Cost Evolution</h3>
        <p>As every technology when is launched, 3D printers were highly expensive at their start. Around the late 80s, a
            new one was priced at $300K, but a decade after it was cut by half already (Figure 2).</p>
        <p>The trend kept going to the downside as seen above (Figure 2) up to the point you can get now a decent 3D
            printer for the low cost of $1,800. Even cheaper ones are starting to be available through crowdfunding
            projects lately [3].</p>
        <p>There is a direct relation between the increasing usage of 3D printers, especially in the business environment,
            and the decreasing cost of the technology. It has become accessible to a large amount of companies making it
            really useful to their own needs.</p>
