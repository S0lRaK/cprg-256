        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This report is a recommendation of using 3D printing technology in hospitals.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This report will help the audience understand the pros and cons of the 3D printing technology, 
            and show some of the possibilities as medical applications.</p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>3D printing is a very interesting topic and now it is being used in some hospitals. 
            At first, we wanted to research if the Alberta Children’s Hospital is using 3D printing, 
            but it turns out that they are not yet implementing the use of 3D printing. 
            They ran a competition about gathering some new ideas of 3D printing applications in hospitals. 
            The results of this competition are not public as November 2018, 
            so we decided to change our topic into 3D Printing in Hospitals instead of focusing in 
            Alberta Children’s Hospital.</p>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of this report includes general aspects of the 3D Printing technology and its applications 
            and revenue specifically in hospitals.</p>
        <p>Legal aspects as patents and the resource share between hospitals will be outside the scope of this report.</p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>For this report the information was gathered through online research in articles and news from professional 
            sources. Alberta Children’s Hospital was reached to get information about the 3D Printing Challenge they ran 
            during October 2018, but it was not released in time for this report.</p>
        <h3>Preview</h3>
        <p>This report will cover the basic of 3D printing, the trends of the technology, the advantages and disadvantages 
            of it, its medical applications, and the revenue of 3D printing. The report finishes with a conclusion.</p>
