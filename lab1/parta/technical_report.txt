Introduction
This report is a recommendation of using 3D printing technology in hospitals.
Purpose
This report will help the audience understand the pros and cons of the 3D printing technology, and show some of the possibilities as medical applications.
Background
3D printing is a very interesting topic and now it is being used in some hospitals. At first, we wanted to research if the Alberta Children’s Hospital is using 3D printing, but it turns out that they are not yet implementing the use of 3D printing. They ran a competition about gathering some new ideas of 3D printing applications in hospitals. The results of this competition are not public as November 2018, so we decided to change our topic into 3D Printing in Hospitals instead of focusing in Alberta Children’s Hospital.
Scope
The scope of this report includes general aspects of the 3D Printing technology and its applications and revenue specifically in hospitals.
Legal aspects as patents and the resource share between hospitals will be outside the scope of this report.
Methods
For this report the information was gathered through online research in articles and news from professional sources. Alberta Children’s Hospital was reached to get information about the 3D Printing Challenge they ran during October 2018, but it was not released in time for this report. 
Preview
This report will cover the basic of 3D printing, the trends of the technology, the advantages and disadvantages of it, its medical applications, and the revenue of 3D printing. The report finishes with a conclusion. 
What is 3D Printing?
According to Oxford dictionaries, “3D printing is the action or process of making a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession” [1]. 
The first step in the 3D printing process is the creation of the blueprint of a given object made by a software. Then the printer interprets this blueprint and throws the melt material through a tube depositing into a plate where gets cooled immediately, starting from the base then building up until the whole object is finished.
Trends
People have been using 3D printer for more than 30 years already, but the costs of them where only achievable by a few. It is only in the last decade that the technology has reached the masses and its usage has exploded into multiple applications.
Worldwide Uses
According to an online worldwide survey made to a thousand participants by Sculpteo in May 2018, the top uses for 3D printing in the last three years have been prototyping, production and proof of concept (Figure 1) [2].
Prototyping has always been the top use during this timing with more than 50% except in 2017, and as can be seen above (Figure 1), 3D printing as a hobby has switched into professional areas from 2015 onwards.
Cost Evolution
As every technology when is launched, 3D printers were highly expensive at their start. Around the late 80s, a new one was priced at $300K, but a decade after it was cut by half already (Figure 2).
The trend kept going to the downside as seen above (Figure 2) up to the point you can get now a decent 3D printer for the low cost of $1,800. Even cheaper ones are starting to be available through crowdfunding projects lately [3].
There is a direct relation between the increasing usage of 3D printers, especially in the business environment, and the decreasing cost of the technology. It has become accessible to a large amount of companies making it really useful to their own needs.
Advantages
3D printing is a new technology that has a direct impact on medical industry. There are two main things that help in advancement in hospitals. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
Faster Productions
Products can quickly move forward from design to prototype which means that can shorten a lot of time to make what the patients need such as personalized prosthesis, organs, blood vessels, etc. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
Making these products, the first thing is the medical data collected. This is generated from patients, which is unique to the individual. The medical data must be segmented and processed according to anatomical features. Data preparation can take longer and it limits medical or surgical procedures which involve long-time planning rather than emergency operation. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
Cost Down
Most medication treatments are expensive, especially for organ transplants but 3D printing can lower down the cost for the issue. For example, when patients need to exchange organs and extend their life, but it always costs a lot of money and time for surgical processes as well. However, this technology can resolve this issue between doctors and patients, as scientists have succeeded in printing 3D structures with living cells by using a new technique called ‘in-air microfluidics’. Printing important organs is one of the biggest advantages of 3D printing due to its cost-effectiveness in the medical sector. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
As a result, 3D printing enables doctors to work faster, shorten patient recovery time and improve operation results. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
Disadvantages
Limited Materials
The materials used in 3D printing are limited. For instance, the 3D printing material of choice is plastic (73%), as shown in Figure 3. Of the many types of plastics available, polyamide is the most common [10]. Some developers are offering metal as a material, but final parts often are not fully dense. There are several more specialized materials that companies are printing in, such as glass and gold, but such technologies have yet to be commercialized [11].
Questionable Accuracy
3D printing is primarily a prototyping technology, meaning that parts created via the technology are mainly test parts. While 3D printers have made advances in accuracy in recent years, many of the plastic materials still come with an accuracy disclaimer. For instance, many materials print to either +/- 0.1 mm in accuracy, meaning there is room for error [11].
Violation of Copyrights
The biggest disadvantage of 3D printing is counterfeiting. Anyone who gets a hold of a blueprint will be able to counterfeit products easily.
Hospital Applications
In some hospitals, 3D printing technology is being used to make toys for children. Those toys are made upon patient’s requests. According to Global News [14], doctors use those toys for therapeutic purposes. It helps children cope with pain and anxiety during treatments. With 3D printing technology, toys can be made very fast and in large quantities. Moreover, money that hospitals have to spend for toys can be much lower since 3D printer materials price are continually dropping.
Besides, applying 3D printing in re-creating body part is trending nowadays. Not only because it is much more affordable than traditional ways, but also it is easier to design and faster to print out. Many hospitals around the world try to apply this technology into their treatment. For example, a dad in UK designed and 3D printed a prosthetic arm for his son [15]. This technology is so easy that even a normal family can access it and make prosthetic body parts for those who need them.
Since 3D printers can be used to replicate body parts, surgeons came up with new applications. For example, 3D printing has helped surgeons treat pediatric heart disease [16] or to remove 50 tumors [17]. Surgeons can use replica models to practice before the real surgery and understand more about the case. This will help the surgery run much smoother, since the surgeons already have based understanding about the case. 
Furthermore, some universities and hospitals around the world are trying to apply 3D printing into making tools for surgery. So far, the results from those researches are positive. According to Journal of Surgical Research website, the cost of 3D printing instruments are only 1/10th the cost of stainless-steel instruments [18]. This could be a trend in the future. Since it is not only cheaper but also customizable, it is suitable with the cases that they are working on.
Revenue from 3D Printing
With so many available applications of the 3D technology in the health care environment, the return from it has already been measured. Below (Figure 9) are the surveyed earnings by IndustryARC in January 2018 worldwide. [19]
The graph shows a clear increasing trending, which is measured in millions of US$. It has to be present that only for 2015 and 2016 the revenue was surveyed, meanwhile 2017 and 2018 are projections, expected to reach over 900 million US$.
Conclusion
3D printing is a technology that creates objects from blueprints, mostly used for prototyping which cost have decreased throughout the years. The main advantages of this technology are the reduced costs and time-saving in production. Even though this technology has some disadvantages such as the limited use of materials, questionable accuracy and copyrights violation, the big amount of applications and benefits that 3D printing offers in hospitals are much higher. On top of that, the revenue expectations are to double from 2015 in only three years.
